<p>If you work on Linux or Mac, you can use alternative software for implementing the examples.</p><p>For Java, you can download Eclipse by choosing the platform as described in the video.</p><p>For C#, you can download MonoDevelop for Linux or Mac. Here is the link:&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.monodevelop.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.monodevelop.com/</a><br></p><p>For C++, you can use Eclipse IDE&nbsp;for C/C++&nbsp;developers. You can use the same steps to download as shown in the lecture&nbsp;"Installation of Eclipse for Java". You only need to choose the correct package and the platform.</p><p>Or you may also download Cevelop for C++. It is based on Eclipse, but more geared towards C++ developers. </p><p>However, you have to download a compiler separately. I&nbsp;recommend using MingW from mingw.org. Download the installer and choose gcc/g++ compiler.</p><p>Cevelop is available as a zip file. Download and unzip it in a directory of your choice and run the Cevelop executable. It will pickup mingw installation directory automatically.</p><p>Here's the link:</p><p><a href="https://www.cevelop.com/download/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.cevelop.com/download/</a><br></p><p>Alternatively, you can use XCode on Mac for C++. XCode can be downloaded directly from Mac Appstore.</p><p><br></p>
